        Australia's Favourite Dish - Hongsta's take on this meal is an absolute winner. If there is only one dish you ever make.
        It has to be this crunchy calamari sensation.

        Salt and Pepper Squid Recipe
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate squid in equal parts salt, sugar, and sesame oil. </li>
        <li>Add the egg white to the squid. Mix well, so all the pieces of squid are covered in the wet mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer the squid to a seperate bowl. Leaving the excess egg white behind.</li>
        <li>Add enough potato starch to cover the squid. Mix together. The starch around the squid should be a dry consisteny.</li>
        <li>Lay the squid out on a tray, so that they are not touching.</li>
        <li>Place the tray in the fridge for a minimum of 20 minutes. The longer the better. (starch rehydration).</li>
        <li>While the squid is hydrating, make the Spiced Salt</li>
        <li>To make the dipping sauce add all ingredients together in a bowl. Taste and balance. </li>
        <li>Heat a wok to 180 degrees with vegetable/sunflower oil.</li>
        <li>Add squid to the oil. Dont put too much in at a time. If the squid stick together, do not try and move them apart. 
            Wait until the squid gets crusty and you will then be able seperate them easily. </li>
        <li>When the squid begin to float, it is a good indication they are ready. </li>
